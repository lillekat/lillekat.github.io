I have contacted ITU Lan, to see if they're planning on organizing an event in the spring period. Waiting for their reply.
I have also contacted Birgit from FM to see, if it's possible to book the tables on the 2nd floor for this perios. Waiting for her reply as well.
When the dates are finally confirmed, I'm announcing them on the website.

I have decided to do the graphics of LilleKat in Figma, so I had to make some minor changes to the text font. (I tried to find a matching font)
But I hope you will like the backgrounds for LilleKat Spring 2022. They're quite fabulous, if I might say.

I have contacted the PROSA union, asking if they would like to support our events with pizza or something similar, and I'm waiting for their respond. Crossing my fingers!
