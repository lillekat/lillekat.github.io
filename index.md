Lille Kat events will be held every other week and are aimed at ITU students from all study programmes who want to spend time solving problems, improving their programming skills, and hanging out with friends. Lille Kat aims to create a friendly and relaxed environment to practice collaborative problem solving; participants are encouraged to help each other and have fun.

The events aim to be fun and challenging for programmers of every skill level. Each event will feature a selection of problems from the [Kattis](https://www.open.kattis.com ) archive. The selected problems will range in difficulty so all participants can solve at least one question, while even the most experienced participants will be challenged by the harder problems.

Oh... and thereâ€™ll be snacks!

## When

Lille Kat events will be held twice a month, on location at ITU. The Kattis server opens at 16:00 so be sure to show up before then to find a seat, grab some snacks, and solve any set up issues before we start.  

- Lille Kat will be back in 2021!

## Lille Kat and Coronavirus

We are working to figure out the best solution for Lille Kat events this semester, currently we expect to meet in person, but with some changes. This means keeping a reasonable distance from other participants and no keyboard sharing (we can recommend looking into [Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/)), it also means Lille Kat will provide individual snacks for everyone rather than having a big pile of shared pizza and chips the way we did it pre-pandemic.

## Where  

### â€¦ do we meet

The 2nd floor Atrium tables will be reserved for Lille Kat events. We'll set out snacks on all of these tables.

## Do I have to prepare

No formal preparation is required, you can show up at the last minute.
However:

- Itâ€™s more fun if you find some friends to team up with. Especially if you think of a good team name!
- One of you should bring a computer for programming, and youâ€™ll need pen and paper for problem solving and collaborative thinking. Bring a charger or make sure your batteries are full.
- If youâ€™ve never done something like this before and want to get a feeling for the type of problems appearing at the events, you can try to solve some easy problems on Open Kattis, such as [hello](https://open.kattis.com/problems/hello), [babybites](https://open.kattis.com/problems/babybites), or [guess](https://open.kattis.com/problems/guess).
This is particularly useful for learning how to read and write input and output. But donâ€™t stress out over this beforehand â€“ weâ€™ll help during the event.

## Where do I ask additional questions

Ask questions and join the conversation at the [Lille Kat channel on ITUâ€™s Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a3f1ac4a2adf040f1892cfe2ec12006c1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=f8d37a29-5c53-44fd-b2c9-bed005d1aee9&tenantId=bea229b6-7a08-4086-b44c-71f57f716bdb)
