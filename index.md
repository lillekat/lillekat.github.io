Lille Kat is a social programming initiative at [ITU](https://www.itu.dk).

Lille Kat events will be held roughly every other week and are aimed at ITU students from all study programmes who want to spend time solving problems, improving their programming skills, and hanging out with friends. Lille Kat aims to create a friendly and relaxed environment to practice collaborative problem solving; participants are encouraged to help each other and have fun.

The events aim to be fun and challenging for programmers of every skill level. Each event will feature a selection of problems from the [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com ) archive. The selected problems will range in difficulty so all participants can solve at least one question, while even the most experienced participants will be challenged by the harder problems.

Oh... and there’ll be snacks!

## When

This semester Lille Kat will be held on campus! The Kattis server is open from 16:00 till 19:00, so be sure to be ready before then. Join the discord server, grab some snacks, and solve any set up issues before we start (people on discord can help if you have any issues).  

### Upcoming events

Events in spring 2022 will be announced soon!

## Lille Kat and Coronavirus

Currently, we expect to meet in person for all events this semester, but with some changes. This means keeping a reasonable distance from other participants and no keyboard sharing (we can recommend looking into [Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/)), it also means Lille Kat will provide individual snacks for everyone rather than having a big pile of shared pizza and chips the way we did it pre-pandemic. Of course, if you are ill or for some other reason would rather stay at home, you can always join virtually on the some kattis contest as the rest of us.

## Where  

The 2nd floor Atrium tables will be reserved for Lille Kat events. We'll set up a snack station on one of these tables (take a look at the Facebook event just before the event to find out which table).

## Do I have to prepare?

No formal preparation is required, you can show up at the last minute.
However:

- It’s more fun if you find some friends to team up with. Especially if you think of a good team name!
- You should bring a computer for programming, and you’ll need pen and paper for problem solving and collaborative thinking.
- If you enjoy writing code together we can recommend looking into [Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/).
- If you’ve never done something like this before and want to get a feeling for the type of problems appearing at the events, you can try to solve some easy problems on Open Kattis, such as [hello](https://open.kattis.com/problems/hello), [babybites](https://open.kattis.com/problems/babybites), or [guess](https://open.kattis.com/problems/guess). This is particularly useful for learning how to read and write input and output. But don’t stress out over this beforehand – we’ll help during the event.

## Where do I ask additional questions

Ask questions and join the conversation at the [Lille Kat channel on ITU’s Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a3f1ac4a2adf040f1892cfe2ec12006c1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=f8d37a29-5c53-44fd-b2c9-bed005d1aee9&tenantId=bea229b6-7a08-4086-b44c-71f57f716bdb) or the Lille Kat discord server [here](https://discord.gg/tGPq46j9E4).
