Lille Kat is a social programming initiative at [ITU](https://www.itu.dk).

Lille Kat events will be held every other week and are aimed at ITU students from all study programmes who want to spend time solving problems, improving their programming skills, and hanging out with friends. Lille Kat aims to create a friendly and relaxed environment to practice collaborative problem solving; participants are encouraged to help each other and have fun.

The events aim to be fun and challenging for programmers of every skill level. Each event will feature a selection of problems from the [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com ) archive. The selected problems will range in difficulty so all participants can solve at least one question, while even the most experienced participants will be challenged by the harder problems.

Oh... and thereâ€™ll be snacks!

## When

Lille Kat will be held online every other week.  The Kattis server is open from 16:00 till 19:00, so be sure to be ready before then. Join the discord server, grab some snacks, and solve any set up issues before we start (people on discord can help if you have any issues).

## Where  

Lille Kat is at it's heart a social event and despite the current restrictions we will continue our social events online and hope you will continue participating, in particular during challenging times, even though it takes more commitment.

Because of the current restrictions, Lille Kat events will be held on discord until further notice.

## Do I have to prepare

No formal preparation is required, you can show up at the last minute.
However:

- Itâ€™s more fun if you find some friends to team up with. Especially if you think of a good team name!
- You should a computer for programming, and youâ€™ll need pen and paper for problem solving and collaborative thinking.
- If you enjoy writing code together we can recommend looking into [Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/).
- If youâ€™ve never done something like this before and want to get a feeling for the type of problems appearing at the events, you can try to solve some easy problems on Open Kattis, such as [hello](https://open.kattis.com/problems/hello), [babybites](https://open.kattis.com/problems/babybites), or [guess](https://open.kattis.com/problems/guess). This is particularly useful for learning how to read and write input and output. But donâ€™t stress out over this beforehand â€“ weâ€™ll help during the event.

## Where do I ask additional questions

Ask questions and join the conversation at the [Lille Kat channel on ITUâ€™s Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a3f1ac4a2adf040f1892cfe2ec12006c1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=f8d37a29-5c53-44fd-b2c9-bed005d1aee9&tenantId=bea229b6-7a08-4086-b44c-71f57f716bdb)
