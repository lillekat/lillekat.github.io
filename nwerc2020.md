# NWERC

Here is what we know about [NWERC 2020](https://www.nwerc.eu/). Those who are interested in participating can read how in the note from Thore below, originally published in the Lille Kat channel on Teams which you can [join here.](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a3f1ac4a2adf040f1892cfe2ec12006c1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=f8d37a29-5c53-44fd-b2c9-bed005d1aee9&tenantId=bea229b6-7a08-4086-b44c-71f57f716bdb)

## Note from Thore

I think I can commit to the following:

- ITU will host 3 ITU teams on site and provide food and drinks

This means we have to find some kind of selection mechanism for selecting the three ITU teams. I can see (and have some experience with) a number of such mechanisms. For instance, we could just go with the three highest place ITU student teams from NCPC. But maybe you want to shuffle teams around in a different way, or can’t attend, etc.
So here’s my decision: Write an expression of interest, to me (as Lille Kat). Looks like this:

> Application for participation in NWERC 2020
>
> Dear Lille Kat,
>
> please consider our application for participating in NWERC 2020. Our team name is “Yet Another Bobby Tables joke”, and we are Alice Cooper, Bob Marley, and Charlene McGee. We placed 2nd among ITU teams at  NCPC 2020, Charlene has 1214 points on Kattis, and …
>
> All the best, and thank you for your good work,
>
> Alice, Bob, and Charlie

I will put a lot of emphasis on past performance as a team (say, NCPC, Lille Kat, other contests). I also put some emphasis on individual competence (such as points on various servers such as Kattis, coursework, grades, TA-ing, etc.). But feel free to emotionally manipulate me with other arguments – a team is a complicated thing. (To be explicit about my biases, I am quite immune to diversity arguments, but I would like to see various study lines represented.)
I like short, crisp, factual evidence. Three sentences are enough. Don’t write an essay.
