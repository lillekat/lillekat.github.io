# Friends of Lille Kat

> **frolic**, /ˈfrɒlɪk/, _verb_, play or move about in a cheerful and lively way. “Robin frolicked with the other Lille Kat people.” _adjective_ (ARCHAIC), cheerful, merry, or playful. “a thousand forms of frolic life.”

> **FroLiK**,  /ˈfrɒlɪk/, _abbreviation_, Friends of Lille Kat, and informal social network at IT University of Copenhagen.

The staff and students connected to Lille Kat constitute an informal social hub for various programming-related events at ITU. 
Lille Kat itself aims to be harmless, accessible, social, and cute.
The other events range in atmosphere from loud and silly to ultra-competitive and serious.
Some of them we arrange ourselves, others we participate in jointly.

## Events


### [NCPC – Nordic Collegiate Programming Contest](https://nordic.icpc.io)


NPCP, sometimes known as _Danmarksmesterskaberne i programmering_, is the “official” yearly Nordic programming contest for universities with a few hundred participants in the Nordic countries.
NCPC is the first step on a series of events culminating in the ICPC world finals.

* Next event: 8 October 2022, 10:00–19:00. The Copenhagen event is organised by _Netcompany_ and held at the University Library of Copenhagen University, Nørre Allé 49, 2200 København N. More information at the websites for [NCPC 2022](https://nordic.icpc.io/ncpc2022/) and [DM i Programmering 2022](https://www.netcompany.com/da/Events/2022/DM-i-programmering-2022).

Five hours of programming, teams of three, registration required (to be announced at the NCPC website). Extremely high quality problems; the easiest problems are like easy Lille Kat, the atmosphere is super, so _everybody_ should participate.

If you’ve done this before and want to actually _train_ for this (you don’t need to):
* [NPCP practice contests online every weekend (5 hours)](http://nordic.icpc.io/ncpc2022/#registration) announced at the NCPC website.
* [NPCP training on site at ITU every Tuesday (2 hours)](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a953ea0c97d904839a4895b975c1524ca%40thread.tacv2/NCPC%25202022%2520Training?groupId=f8d37a29-5c53-44fd-b2c9-bed005d1aee9&tenantId=bea229b6-7a08-4086-b44c-71f57f716bdb) announced at an ITU-internal MS Teams channel.

### [Will Code for Drinks](https://thorehusfeldt.github.io/wcfd/)

Atmosphere is crazy. Held in the ITU Scrollbar, typically in November. Difficulty comparable to Lille Kat; but even more focussed on having fun. By now, one of the largest programming events in Scandinavia.

* Next event: 11 November 2022.

### [NWERC –  Northwestern European Regional Contest](https://nwerc.eu)

NWERC is a highly competitive annual event – the next next step above NCPC, and a qualifier for the World finals.
ITU sponsors two teams to participate. (Maybe three if we can find the money.)

* Next event: 25 to 27 November 2022, Delft, Netherlands.

Team selection and coaching for NWERC is done by FroLiK.

### [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)

AoC is a world-wide daily _julekalender_ in December; ITU participants maintain 
* a shared leaderboard (code 968368-7136f90c) and 
* an [Advent of Code channel on ITU Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a35ac58a2e8344a80b326c01f3fab6ded%40thread.tacv2/Advent%2520of%2520Code?groupId=f8d37a29-5c53-44fd-b2c9-bed005d1aee9&tenantId=bea229b6-7a08-4086-b44c-71f57f716bdb) to talk about today’s problem. 

Quite difficult on some days.
