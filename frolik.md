# Friends of Lille Kat

> **frolic**, /ˈfrɒlɪk/, _verb_, play or move about in a cheerful and lively way. “Robin frolicked with the other Lille Kat people.” _adjective_ (ARCHAIC), cheerful, merry, or playful. “a thousand forms of frolic life.”

> **FroLiK**,  /ˈfrɒlɪk/, _abbreviation_, Friends of Lille Kat, and informal social network at IT University of Copenhagen.

The staff and students connected to Lille Kat constitute an informal social hub for various programming-related events at ITU. 
Lille Kat itself aims to be harmless, accessible, social, and cute.
The other events range in atmosphere from loud and silly to ultra-competitive and serious.
Some of them we arrange ourselves, others we participate in jointly.

## Events


### [NCPC – Nordic Collegiate Programming Contest](https://nordic.icpc.io)


NPCP, sometimes known as _Danmarksmesterskaberne i programmering_, is the “official” yearly Nordic programming contest for universities with a few hundred participants in the Nordic countries.
NCPC is the first step on a series of events culminating in the ICPC world finals.

NCPC is five hours of programming in teams of three, registration required (to be announced at the NCPC website). The problem quality is extremely high; the easiest problems are like easy Lille Kat, the atmosphere is super, so _everybody_ should participate.

* Next event: 7 October 2023, 10:00–19:00. The Copenhagen event is organised by _Netcompany_ and _Jobindex_ and held at the KU Science Campus (“Nørre campus”) at Biocenter Kantine, Ole Maaløes Vej 5, 2200 København N. More information at the website for [NCPC](https://nordic.icpc.io/ncpc2023/). 

### [Will Code for Drinks](https://thorehusfeldt.github.io/wcfd/)

Held in the ITU Scrollbar, typically in November. Difficulty comparable to Lille Kat; but even more focussed on having fun. By now, one of the largest programming events in Scandinavia.
Atmosphere is crazy. 

* Next event: November-ish 2023, depending on Scrollbar.

### [NWERC –  Northwestern European Regional Contest](https://nwerc.eu)

NWERC is a highly competitive annual event – the next next step above NCPC, and a qualifier for the World finals.
ITU typically sponsors two or three teams to participate (travel and lodgings).

* Next event: Late November – early December 2023, Delft, Netherlands.

Team selection and coaching for NWERC is done by FroLiK.

### [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)

AoC is a world-wide daily _julekalender_ in December; ITU participants maintain 
* a shared leaderboard (code 968368-7136f90c) and 
* an [Advent of Code channel on ITU Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a35ac58a2e8344a80b326c01f3fab6ded%40thread.tacv2/Advent%2520of%2520Code?groupId=f8d37a29-5c53-44fd-b2c9-bed005d1aee9&tenantId=bea229b6-7a08-4086-b44c-71f57f716bdb) to talk about today’s problem. 

Quite difficult on some days.
