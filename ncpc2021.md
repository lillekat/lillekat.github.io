## Who can participate?

Everyone are very welcome! 
It does not matter whether you have been programming for many years or a few weeks. 
There are problems for everyone. You can find the problems from last year with solutions [here](https://nordic.icpc.io/ncpc2020/).

PLEASE NOTE: The physical event is for ITU students and staff only. 

## Preparation

1. Find a team, preferably of fellow students that you already interact with. Your study group would be perfect; you can be at most 3. Come up with a clever team name.
2. Train by solving previous NCPC problems in your team. See [NCPC site](https://nordic.icpc.io).
   As you can see, if you manage to solve just 1 problem, you are in very select company.
